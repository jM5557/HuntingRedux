				<p>
				Hunting REDUX is a fan-made project aiming to enhance the textures of several Monster Hunter titles. 
			</p>

			<p>
				Our main goal is to transform already stunning games into experiences still visually enjoyable today. The core of our project focuses on major texture improvements. Our first project, <i>Monster Hunter Portable 3rd Redux</i>, transforms an already vibrant title into an experience still enjoyable today. Texture packs are planned and released in stages as the development progresses. Afterwards, we plan to continually support completed projects through seasonal updates and events. We hope you look forward to it.  
			</p>

			<p>
				The <i>MHP3rd Redux</i> texture packs can only be used with the PPSSPP Emulator, available on PC (Windows, MacOSX, Linux), Android, and iOS.
