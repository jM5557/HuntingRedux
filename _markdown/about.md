						<p>
							Hunting REDUX is a passion project aiming to enhance older Monster Hunter titles.

							Our main goal is to transform already stunning games into experiences still visually enjoyable today. 

							The core of our project focuses on major texture improvements by Icewind, but we have also exclusively remastered several cinematics across the older titles. 
								<br />
								<br />		
							Our first project, <i>Monster Hunter Portable 3rd Redux</i>, features a wholescale redesign, from monsters to the UI. 
								<br />
							Texture Packs are planned and released in stages as development progresses. Afterwards, we plan to continually support completed projects through seasonal updates and events. 
								<br />
							We hope you look forward to it.  

							<i>MHP3rd Redux</i> Texture Packs can only be used with the PPSSPP Emulator, available on PC (Windows, MacOSX, Linux), Android, and iOS.
