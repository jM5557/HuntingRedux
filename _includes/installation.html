			Download and install PPSSPP	along with the latest {{ include.gameSubname }} release.	
		</p>

		<p>

			Use a zip extractor to extract the contents of the project into a separate folder. We recommend 7zip.

				<br>
				<br>

			Afterwards, place the extracted contents into the following location of your PPSSPP installation directory:
			
			<p class="sub_direct">
				<span>memstick</span>
				<span>PSP</span>
				<span>TEXTURES</span>
				<span>ULUS10391</span>
			</p>

		</p>

		<p>
			
			On MacOSX, you can locate this folder in:

			<p class="sub_direct">
				<span>~</span>
				<span>.config</span>
				<span>ppsspp</span>
				<span>PSP</span>
			</p>

		</p>

		<p>
			Make sure to check this option in PPSSPP:

			<p class="sub_direct">
				<span>Settings</span>
				<span>Tools</span>
				<span>Developer Tools</span>
				<span>Replace Textures</span>
			</p>
